This is a application designed for CS-320 Software testing and automations.
To ensure that my code, program and software are functional and secure begins with choosing the proper programing language that will best suit the of the project. As well as choosing a programming language that you are skillful in. If a programming language is chosen that a developer is not skillfully familiar with this could lead to catastrphic bug failures and costing the company a fortune. To ensure functionality frequent checks with the software requirments document is imperative to ensure no functions are over looked. To interpret a users needs a well established form of communication is essential. The software requirments document will need multiple revisions as the project progresses down the software development lifecycle. Features may look great on paper but in terms of functionality may be impossible of bug inducing. The way I will approach designing anysoftware will be by communicating with the person hiring me. Designing a software requirments document with the user to ensure my development is on track from the beginning. By using this approach I will stay organized and have good commuinication with all parties.
